# Introduction about Itomori

Itomiri is a **quick short note taking** app. Which is blazingly fast, simple, easy to use, works everywhere, ultra minimalistic. This the docs section of Itomori, it is not the website, it is the official website. This official documentation is open source, anyone can contribute to it! **Thanks for using Itomori. Have a nice day.**
